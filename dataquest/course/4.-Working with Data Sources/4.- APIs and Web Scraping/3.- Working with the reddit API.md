# 3.- Challenge: Working with the reddit API

* Using `OAuth` to authenticate:
```python
{"Authorization": "bearer 13426216-4U1ckno9J5AiK72VRbpEeBaMSKk", "User-Agent": "Dataquest/1.0"}
```

* Getting top posts for the past day:
```python
headers = {"Authorization": "bearer 13426216-4U1ckno9J5AiK72VRbpEeBaMSKk", "User-Agent": "Dataquest/1.0"}

response = requests.get("https://oauth.reddit.com/r/python/top", headers=headers, params={"t":"day"})

python_top = response.json()
```

* Getting post with most upvotes:
```python
python_top_articles = python_top["data"]

most_upvoted = ""
most_upvotes = 0


for child in python_top_articles["children"]:
    if child["data"]["ups"] > most_upvotes:
        most_upvoted = child["data"]["id"]
        most_upvotes = child["data"]["ups"]
```

* Getting post comments:

```python
# This API has the id of the post.
response = requests.get("https://oauth.reddit.com/r/python/comments/4b7w9u", headers=headers)
comments = response.json()
```

* Getting comment with most upvotes:

```python
comments_list = comments[1]["data"]["children"]

most_upvoted_comment = ""
most_upvotes = 0

for comment in comments_list:
    if comment["data"]["ups"] > most_upvotes:
        most_upvotes = comment["data"]["ups"]
        most_upvoted_comment = comment["data"]["id"]
```

* Upvote a comment:

```python
# This payload has the id of the comment to upvote.
payload = {"dir": 1, "id": "d16y4ry"}
response = requests.post("https://oauth.reddit.com/api/vote", json=payload, headers=headers)
status = response.status_code
```
