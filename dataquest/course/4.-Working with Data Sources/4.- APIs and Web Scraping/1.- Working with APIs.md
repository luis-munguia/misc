# 1.- Working with APIs

* The API usually returns this data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

* Using the `requests` library and `.get` request:

```python
import requests
response = requests.get("http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json")
status_code = response.status_code
print(status_code)

Output
200
```

* Status code types:

`200` - Everything went okay, and the server returned a result (if any).

`301` - The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint. This can happen when a company switches domain names, or an endpoint's name has changed.

`401` - The server thinks you're not authenticated. This happens when you don't send the right credentials to access an API (we'll talk about this in a later mission).

`400` - The server thinks you made a bad request. This can happen when you don't send the information the API requires to process your request, among other things.

`403` - The resource you're trying to access is forbidden; you don't have the right permissions to see it.

`404` - The server didn't find the resource you tried to access.

* Using parameters:

```python
# Set up the parameters we want to pass to the API.
# This is the latitude and longitude of New York City.
parameters = {"lat": 40.71, "lon": -74}

# Make a get request with the parameters.
response = requests.get("http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json", params=parameters)

# Print the content of the response (the data the server returned).
print(response.content)

# This gets the same data as the command above (Not recommended because `requests` takes care of certain issues).
response = requests.get("http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json?lat=40.71&lon=-74")
print(response.content)
```
* `JSON` library:

`dumps` - Takes in a Python object, and converts it to a `string`.

`loads` - Takes a `JSON` `string`, and converts it to a Python object.

```SQL
# Make a list of fast food chains.
best_food_chains = ["Taco Bell", "Shake Shack", "Chipotle"]
print(type(best_food_chains))

# Import the JSON library.
import json

# Use json.dumps to convert best_food_chains to a string.
best_food_chains_string = json.dumps(best_food_chains)
print(type(best_food_chains_string))

# Convert best_food_chains_string back to a list.
print(type(json.loads(best_food_chains_string)))

# Make a dictionary.
fast_food_franchise = {
    "Subway": 24722,
    "McDonalds": 14098,
    "Starbucks": 10821,
    "Pizza Hut": 7600
}

# We can also dump a dictionary to a string and load it.
fast_food_franchise_string = json.dumps(fast_food_franchise)
print(type(fast_food_franchise_string))

# Load a JSON string and convert it to a dictionary.

fast_food_franchise_2 = json.loads(fast_food_franchise_string)
```
* Using `.json()` method of the `response` library to get a Python object:

```python
# Make the same request.
parameters = {"lat": 37.78, "lon": -122.41}
response = requests.get("http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json", params=parameters)

# Get the response data as a Python object.  Verify that it's a dictionary.
json_data = response.json()
print(type(json_data))
print(json_data)

# Get first value of duration value.
first_pass_duration = json_data["response"][0]["duration"]

* Using `.headers` property to access metadata.
```python
# response.headers is a dictionary
content_type = response.headers["content-type"]
```

* OpenNotify `astros.json` API endpoint:

```python
response = requests.get("http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json")
json_data = response.json()
in_space_count = json_data['number']
print(in_space_count)
```
