# 2.- Intermediate APIs

* Using `token` and `requests` to make authenticated requests:

```python
# Create a dictionary of headers containing our Authorization header.
headers = {"Authorization": "token 1f36137fbbe1602f779300dad26e4c1b7fbab631"}

# Make a GET request to the GitHub API with our headers.
# This API endpoint will give us details about Vik Paruchuri.
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com/users/VikParuchuri", headers=headers)

# Print the content of the response.  As you can see, this token corresponds to the account of Vik Paruchuri.
print(response.json())

# Make request with orgs to receive a list of the organization a Github user belongs to.
response2 = requests.get("https://api.github.com/users/VikParuchuri/orgs", headers=headers)
orgs = response2.json()
```

* Using `headers` to receive data from other Github users:

```python
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com/users/torvalds", headers=headers)
torvalds = response.json()
```

* Using `params` for pagination:

```python
params = {"per_page": 50, "page": 1}
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com/users/VikParuchuri/starred", headers=headers, params=params)
page1_repos = response.json()

params = {"per_page":50, "page":2}
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com/users/VikParuchuri/starred", headers=headers, params=params)
page2_repos = response.json()
```

* Getting user information:

```python
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com/user", headers=headers)
user = response.json()
```

* Using `requests.post` to send information:

`201` - Status code indication that a `POST` request was able to create an object on server.

```python
# Create the data we'll pass into the API endpoint.  While this endpoint only requires the "name" key, there are other optional keys.
payload = {"name": "test"}

# We need to pass in our authentication headers!
response = requests.post("https://api.github.com/user/repos", json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.status_code)

# Second post.
payload2 = {"name": "learning-about-apis"}
response2 = requests.post("https://api.github.com/user/repos", json=payload2, headers=headers)
status = response2.status_code
print(response2.status_code)
```

* Updating existing objects with `PATCH` or `PUT` requests:
`patch` - Change a few attributes of an object.
`put` - Change all attributes of an object.
`200` - Status code indication that a `PATCH` request was successful.

```python
payload = {"description": "The best repository ever!", "name": "test"}
response = requests.patch("https://api.github.com/repos/VikParuchuri/test", json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.status_code)

payload2 = {"description": "Learning about requests!", "name": "learning-about-apis"}
response2 = requests.patch("https://api.github.com/repos/VikParuchuri/learning-about-apis", json=payload2, headers=headers)
status = response2.status_code
print(status)
```

* Deleting existing objects with `DELETE` requests:
`204` - Status code indication that a `DELETE` request was sucessful.

```python
response = requests.delete("https://api.github.com/repos/VikParuchuri/test", headers=headers)
print(response.status_code)

response2 = requests.delete("https://api.github.com/repos/VikParuchuri/learning-about-apis", headers=headers)
status = response2.status_code
print(status)
```
