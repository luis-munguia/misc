# 5.- Querying SQLite from Python

It's better to use SQLite with files larger than 8 gigabytes, as Pandas will load the entire data set into memory.

* Getting started with SQLite:

```python
import sqlite3
# Connect function returns a Connection instance.
conn = sqlite3.connect("jobs.db")
```
* SQL query need to be expressed as a *string.* and we need to use a `Cursor class`:

```python
# Connection instance method to return a Cursor instance.
cursor = conn.cursor()
# SQL Query as a string.
query = "SELECT column FROM table;"
# Execute the query, convert the results to tuples, and store as a local variable.
cursor.execute(query)
# Fetch the full results set as a list of tuples.
results = cursor.fetchall()
# Display the first three results.
print(results[0:3])
```
* SQLite allows skipping the creation of the `Cursor class` by using the `execute method` within the `Connection object`:

```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("jobs.db")
query = "SELECT * FROM table;"
conn.execute(query).fetchall()
```
* We can limit the number of results we want to retrieve at any given time:
```python
# Returns a single result, and then increment its internal counter by 1.
first_result = cursor.fetchone()
# Returns a single result, this time it's the second tuple, and has increased its internal counter by 1.
second_result = cursor.fetchone()
# Returns a "n" number of results, and increases its internal counter by "n".
next_five_results = cursor.fechmany(5)
```
* SQLite restricts acces to the database file when connected to the database, so it's necesary to close the connection to allow other processes to access the database:

```python
conn.close()
```
