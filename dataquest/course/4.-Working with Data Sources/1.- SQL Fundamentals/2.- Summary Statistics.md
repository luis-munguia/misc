# 2.- Summary Statistics
* We can use the following functions:

```SQL 
SELECT MIN("column") FROM "table";
SELECT MAX("column") FROM "table";
SELECT COUNT("column") FROM "table";
SELECT AVG("column") FROM "table";
SELECT SUM("column") FROM "table";
SELECT TOTAL("column") FROM "table";
```
* `AS` operator, to change names of columns and tables:

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "new_column_name" FROM "table" AS "new_table_name";
```
* `DISTINCT` statement, to select unique values:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT "column" FROM "table";
```

* `*`, `+`, `-`, `/` operators, to make standard arithmetic operations:

```SQL
SELECT "column1" - "column2" FROM "table" LIMIT 10;
```
* Use 1.0 to convert to a float without casting:

```SQL
SELECT 1.0 * "column1" FROM "table";
```
