# 1.- Introduction to SQL: Takeaways 

Pandas is great to use with datasets that fit in memory and are static:

But there are times when this is not possible. In these cases we need to use a database management system (**DBMS**):

* Getting Started with SQL:
``` SQL
SELECT "column or columns" FROM "table"

WHERE "condition1" OR "condition2" AND "condition3" ORDER BY "column" DESC LIMIT "number";
```
* `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `=`, `!= ` are the comparison operators in SQL:
```SQL
SELECT "column1" FROM "table1"
WHERE "column1" = 0;
```
