# The Weighted Mean and the Median

* Errors will occur when giving each classifier the same weight:

```python
houses_per_year
houses_per_year["Sum Price"] = houses_per_year["Mean Price"] * houses_per_year["Houses Sold"]
weighted_mean = houses_per_year["Sum Price"].sum() / houses_per_year["Houses Sold"].sum()
mean_original = houses["SalePrice"].mean()
difference = round(weighted_mean,10) - round(mean_original,10)
```

* My version:

```python
def weighted_mean(list1, list2):
    numerator = 0    
    denominator = 0
    for i, k in enumerate(list1):
        numerator += k * list2[i]
        denominator += list2[i]
                
    return numerator / denominator

weighted_mean_function = weighted_mean(houses_per_year["Mean Price"], houses_per_year["Houses Sold"])

weighted_mean_numpy = numpy.average(houses_per_year["Mean Price"], weights = houses_per_year["Houses Sold"])

equal = round(weighted_mean_function,10) == round(weighted_mean_numpy,10)
```
* Dataquest's version:

```python
def weighted_mean(distribution, weights):
    weighted_sum = []
    for mean, weight in zip(distribution, weights):
        weighted_sum.append(mean * weight)
    
    return sum(weighted_sum) / sum(weights)

weighted_mean_function = weighted_mean(houses_per_year['Mean Price'],
                                       houses_per_year['Houses Sold'])

from numpy import average
weighted_mean_numpy = average(houses_per_year['Mean Price'],
        weights = houses_per_year['Houses Sold'])

equal = round(weighted_mean_function, 10) == round(weighted_mean_numpy, 10)
```
