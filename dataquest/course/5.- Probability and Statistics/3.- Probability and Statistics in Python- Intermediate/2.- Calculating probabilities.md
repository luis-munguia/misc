# 2.- Calculating probabilities

* Probability of renting bikes:

```python
import pandas
bikes = pandas.read_csv("bike_rental_day.csv")

# Find the number of days the bikes rented exceeded the threshold.
days_over_threshold = bikes[bikes["cnt"] > 2000].shape[0]
# Find the total number of days we have data for.
total_days = bikes.shape[0]

# Get the probability that more than 2000 bikes were rented for any given day.
probability_over_2000 = days_over_threshold / total_days
print(probability_over_2000)

probability_over_4000 = bikes[bikes["cnt"] > 4000].shape[0] / total_days
```

* Finding the number of combinations:

```python
import math
def find_outcome_combinations(N, k):
    # Calculate the numerator of our formula.
    numerator = math.factorial(N)
    # Calculate the denominator.
    denominator = math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(N - k)
    # Divide them to get the final value.
    return numerator / denominator
```

* Finding the probability of a single combination:

```python
def probable(p, q, N, k):
    
    return (p ** k) * (q ** (N - k))
```

* Statistical significance:

If an event happens more than `5%` of the time by random chance, then it isn't statistically significant.
