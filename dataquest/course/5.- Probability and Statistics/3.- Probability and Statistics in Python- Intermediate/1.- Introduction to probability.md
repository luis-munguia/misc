# 1.- Introduction to probability

* Probability basics

```python
# Sort a dataframe and return the max value.
bars_sorted = flags.sort_values(by = "bars", ascending = False)
most_bars_contry = bars_sorted["name"].iloc[0]

```

* Calculating probability:

```python
total_countries = flags.shape[0]

orange_probability = flags["orange"].value_counts().iloc[1] / total_countries

stripe_probability = 1 - flags["stripes"].value_counts(normalize = True).sort_index().iloc[0:2].sum()
```

* Conjunctive probabilities, the outcome is not affected by the choices:

```python
five_heads = .5 ** 5

ten_heads = .5 ** 10

hundred_heads = .5 ** 100
```

* Dependent probabilities, the outcome is affected by the choices:

```python
# Remember that whether a flag has red in it or not is in the `red` column.

red_cty = flags["red"].value_counts().iloc[0]
total_cty = flags["red"].shape[0]

three_red = 1
for i in range(3):
    prob = red_cty / total_cty
    three_red *= prob
    red_cty -= 1
    total_cty -= 1
```

* Disjunctive probability:

```python
start = 1
end = 18000

count_100 = 0
count_70 = 0

for i in range(start, end + 1):
    if i % 100 == 0:
        count_100 += 1
    if i % 70 == 0:
        count_70 += 1

hundred_prob = count_100 / end
seventy_prob = count_70 / end
```

* Disjunctive dependent probabilities:

```python
roflags = flags[(flags["red"] == 1) | (flags["orange"] ==1)].shape[0]
stbflags = flags[(flags["stripes"] > 0) | (flags["bars"] > 0)].shape[0]
red_or_orange = roflags / flags.shape[0]
stripes_or_bars = stbflags / flags.shape[0]
```

* Disjunctive probabilities with multiple conditions:

```python
heads_or = 1 - (.5 ** 3)
```
