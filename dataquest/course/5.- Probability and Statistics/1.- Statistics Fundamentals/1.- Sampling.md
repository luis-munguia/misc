* Use `pandas` and `series.sample()` to determine parameters, statistics and sampling errors:

![Sample](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/283/s1m1_two_samples.svg)

```python
import pandas as pd
wnba = pd.read_csv('wnba.csv')

wnba.head()
wnba.tail()
wnba.shape

parameter = wnba["Games Played"].max()
sample = wnba["Games Played"].sample(random_state = 1)

statistic = sample.max()

sampling_error = parameter - statistic
```

* Use `matplotlib` library to visualize sampling errors:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

wnba = pd.read_csv('wnba.csv')

stat_means = []

for i in range(100):
    sample = wnba["PTS"].sample(10, random_state = i)
    stat_means.append(sample.mean())
    
para_mean = wnba["PTS"].mean()

# Must change range to include 1 and 100 for answer verification purposes.
plt.scatter(x=range(1,101), y=stat_means)
plt.axhline(para_mean)
```

* Stratifying data to get representative samples:

![SRS](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/283/s1m1_srs_down.svg)

```python
wnba["PPG"] = wnba["PTS"]/wnba["Games Played"]

pos = ["F", "G", "C", "G/F", "F/C"]
means = {}

for p in pos:
    stuff = wnba[wnba["Pos"] == p]
    means[p] = stuff["PPG"].sample(10, random_state = 0).mean()
       
position_most_points = max(means, key=means.get)
```

* Stratifying population to get representative sample:

![Stratum2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/283/s1m1_quota_sampling_v2.svg)

```python
wnba112 = wnba[wnba['Games Played'] <= 12]
wnba1322 = wnba[(wnba['Games Played'] > 12) & (wnba['Games Played'] <= 22)]
wnba2332 = wnba[wnba['Games Played'] > 22]

meanlist = []
para_mean = wnba['PTS'].mean()

for i in range(100):
    sample1 = wnba112['PTS'].sample(1, random_state = i)
    sample2 = wnba1322['PTS'].sample(2, random_state = i)
    sample3 = wnba2332['PTS'].sample(7, random_state = i)
    meanlist.append(pd.concat([sample1, sample2, sample3]).mean())
       
plt.scatter(x = range(1,101), y=meanlist)
plt.axhline(para_mean)
```

* It didn't seem to improve a lot.

![Stratum4](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/283/quota_minutes.png)

```python
print(wnba['MIN'].value_counts(bins = 3, normalize = True)*100)

wnba10347 = wnba[wnba['MIN'] <= 347.333]
wnba347682 = wnba[(wnba['MIN'] > 347.333) & (wnba['MIN'] <= 682.667)]
wnba6821018 = wnba[wnba['MIN'] > 682.667]

meanlist = []

for i in range(100):
    sample1 = wnba10347['PTS'].sample(4, random_state = i)
    sample2 = wnba347682['PTS'].sample(4, random_state = i)
    sample3 = wnba6821018['PTS'].sample(4, random_state = i)
    meanlist.append(pd.concat([sample1, sample2, sample3]).mean())
    
plt.scatter(range(1,101), meanlist)
plt.axhline(wnba['PTS'].mean())
```

* Cluster sampling:

![Cluster](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/283/s1m1_cluster_sampling_v2.svg)

```python
clusters = pd.Series(wnba['Team'].unique()).sample(4, random_state = 0)

sample = pd.DataFrame()

for cluster in clusters:
    sample = sample.append(wnba[wnba['Team'] == cluster])
    
sampling_error_height = wnba["Height"].mean() - sample["Height"].mean()
sampling_error_age = wnba["Age"].mean() - sample["Age"].mean()
sampling_error_BMI = wnba["BMI"].mean() - sample["BMI"].mean()
sampling_error_points = wnba["PTS"].mean() - sample["PTS"].mean()
```
