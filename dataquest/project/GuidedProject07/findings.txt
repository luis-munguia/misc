This is really strange project.
I was able to do steps 1 to 3.
There are more Males in Juvenile Justice Facility than Females.
The gender ratio for males and females students is almost the same in Magnet Schools.
I prefer working with Jupyter.

I felt great when I was able to complete step 4. It seems that resting did it's job.

According to the analysis, it seems that the race that enrolls more in school are Hispanics.

All the other races enroll less in comparison to the demographic data.
Only the females of Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and Two or more races have higher enrollment than their males counterparts.
