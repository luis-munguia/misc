# 4.- Significance Testing

* Hypothesis testing and Research design:
  * Null hypotesis and alternative hypothesis
  
* Permutation test:

```python
mean_difference = 2.52
print(all_values)

mean_differences = []

for i in range(1000):
    group_a = []
    group_b = []
    
    for value in all_values:
        if np.random.rand() >= 0.5:
            group_a.append(value)
        else:
            group_b.append(value)
    mean_differences.append(np.mean(group_b) - np.mean(group_a))
    
plt.hist(mean_differences)
plt.show()
```

* Dictionary representation of a distribution:

```python
empty = {}

# Since "a" isn't a key in empty, the value False is returned.
key_a = empty.get("a", False):

empty["b"] = "boat"

# key_b is the value for the key "b" in empty.
key_b = empty.get("b", False):
# "boat" is assigned to key_b.
```

```python
empty = {"c": 1}
if empty.get("c", False):
    # If in the dictionary, grab the value, increment by 1, reassign.
    val = empty.get("c")
    inc = val + 1
    empty["c"] = inc
else:
    # If not in the dictionary, assign `1` as the value to that key.
    empty["c"] = 1
```

```python
# Dataquest answer:
sampling_distribution = {}
for df in mean_differences:
    if sampling_distribution.get(df, False):
        sampling_distribution[df] = sampling_distribution[df] + 1
    else:
        sampling_distribution[df] = 1
```

```python
# My answer:
sampling_distribution = {}

for i in mean_differences:
    if i in sampling_distribution:
        sampling_distribution[i] += 1
    else:
        sampling_distribution[i] = 1
```

* P value:

```python
frequencies = []

for key in sampling_distribution:
    if key >= 2.52:
        frequencies.append(key)
p_value = np.sum(frequencies) / 1000

# In this case `p_value = 0`, which means it's smaller than `5%`.
```

* Caveats:

  * Type I error is when you accept the alternative hypothesis because of a high p value threshold.
  * Type II error is when you reject the alternative hypothesis because of a low p value threshold.
