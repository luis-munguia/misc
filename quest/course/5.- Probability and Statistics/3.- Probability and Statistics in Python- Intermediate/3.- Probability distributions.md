# 3.- Probability distributions

* Computing a probability distribution:

```python
import math

# Each item in this list represents one k, starting from 0 and going up to and including 30.
outcome_counts = list(range(31))

def probable(p, q, N, k):
    
    # This is the number of outcomes.
    
    numerator = math.factorial(N)
    denominator = math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(N - k)
    outcomes = numerator / denominator
    
    # This is the probability of a single combination.
    
    probability = (p ** k) * (q ** (N - k))
    
    return probability * outcomes

# Use list comprehension.
outcome_probs = [probable(.39, .61, 30, i) for i in outcome_counts]  
```


* Using `SciPy` to compute it faster:

```python
from scipy import linspace
from scipy.stats import binom

# Create a range of numbers from 0 to 30, with 31 elements (each number has one entry).
outcome_counts = linspace(0,30,31)

# Create the binomial probabilities, one for each entry in outcome_counts.
dist = binom.pmf(outcome_counts,30,0.39)
```

* Probability Ditribution Mean and Standard Deviation:

```python

# Mean = N * p
dist_mean = 30 * .39

# Stdev = SQRT(N * p * q)
dist_stdev = math.sqrt(30 * .39 * .61)
```

* Using different events:

```python
outcome_counts10 = linspace(0, 10, 11)
dist10 = binom.pmf(outcome_counts10, 10, 0.39)

plt.bar(outcome_counts10, dist10)
plt.show()

outcome_counts100 = linspace(0, 100, 101)
dist100 = binom.pmf(outcome_counts100, 100, 0.39)

plt.bar(outcome_counts100, dist100)
plt.show()
```

* Cumulative density function:

```python
# Flipping a coin 3 times.
k    probability

0    .125
1    .375
2    .375
3    .125

# Cumulative ditribution:

k    probability

0    .125
1    .5
2    .875
3    1

# Using binom.cdf in scipy:

from scipy import linspace
from scipy.stats import binom

# Create a range of numbers from 0 to 30, with 31 elements (each number has one entry).
outcome_counts = linspace(0,30,31)

# Create the cumulative binomial probabilities, one for each entry in outcome_counts.
dist = binom.cdf(outcome_counts,30,0.39)
```

* Z-scores:

```python
# The sum of all the probabilities to the left of k, including k.
left = binom.cdf(k,N,p)

# The sum of all probabilities to the right of k.
right = 1 - left
```
