# 3.- Building and Organizing Complex Queries
* `WITH` clause allows to define one or more named subqueries before the start of the main query:

```SQL
WITH [alias_name] AS ([subquery])
SELECT [main_query] FROM [alias_name]
```

```SQL
WITH track_info AS
    (                
     SELECT
         t.name,
         ar.name artist,
         al.title album_name,
         mt.name media_type,
         g.name genre,
         t.milliseconds length_milliseconds
     FROM track t
     INNER JOIN media_type mt ON mt.media_type_id = t.media_type_id
     INNER JOIN genre g ON g.genre_id = t.genre_id
     INNER JOIN album al ON al.album_id = t.album_id
     INNER JOIN artist ar ON ar.artist_id = al.artist_id
    )

SELECT * FROM track_info
WHERE album_name = "Jagged Little Pill";
```
* `CREATE VIEW` statement allows to permanently define a subquery:

```SQL
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT * FROM table;
```

```SQL
/*This code uses database.view_name and database.table because the database
was manually attached to the exercise. It's not needed in Jupyter or SQLite */
CREATE VIEW chinook.customer_2 AS
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        first_name || last_name name,
        phone,
        email,
        support_rep_id
    FROM chinook.customer;
```
* A view cannot be redefined or modified, it needs to be drop instead:

```SQL
DROP VIEW chinook.customer_2;
```
* `UNION` operator is used to join rows from tables and/or views:

![Union](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/190/union_vs_join.svg)

```SQL
[select_statement_one]
UNION
[select_statement_two]
```
![Union2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/190/union_types.svg)
* Set operations:
![Set](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/190/set_operations.svg)

```SQL
SELECT * from customer_usa

INTERSECT

SELECT * from customer_gt_90_dollars;
```

```SQL
SELECT * from customer_usa

EXCEPT

SELECT * from customer_gt_90_dollars;
```
* `WITH` multiple subqueries:

```SQL
WITH
    [alias_name] AS ([subquery]),
    [alias_name_2] AS ([subquery_2]),
    [alias_name_3] AS ([subquery_3])

SELECT [main_query]
```
