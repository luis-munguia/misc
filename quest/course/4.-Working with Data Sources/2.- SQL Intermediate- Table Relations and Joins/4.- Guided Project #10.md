* Helper functions in SQLite to run queries, commands and show tables:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline

def run_query(q):
    with sqlite3.connect('chinook.db') as conn:
        return pd.read_sql(q, conn)
    
def run_command(c):
    with sqlite3.connect('chinook.db') as conn:
        conn.isolation_level = None
        return conn.execute(c)

def show_tables():
    query = """SELECT name, type 
                    FROM sqlite_master 
                    WHERE type IN ('table','view');
                    """
    return run_query(query)

```

* Using `set_index()` to set the index of the dataframe to a different column:

```python
df.set_index("column_name", drop=True,inplace=True)
```
* Using `CASE` and `CREATE VIEW` to force a value to the bottom of the table:

```SQL
CREATE VIEW countries_others AS 
            SELECT
               CASE
                   WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer WHERE country = c.country) = 1 THEN "Other"
                   ELSE c.country
               END AS Country,
               c.customer_id,
               il.*
                 FROM invoice_line il
                 INNER JOIN invoice i ON i.invoice_id = il.invoice_id
                 INNER JOIN customer c ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
```

```SQL
SELECT 
                Country,
                "Total Customers",
                "Total Sales in USD",
                "Average Value of Sales by Customer",
                "Average Order Value"
            FROM
            
            (SELECT 
            c.country AS Country,
            COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS "Total Customers",
            SUM(c.unit_price) AS "Total Sales in USD",
            SUM(c.unit_price)/COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS "Average Value of Sales by Customer",
            SUM(c.unit_price)/COUNT(DISTINCT c.invoice_id) AS "Average Order Value",
            CASE
                WHEN c.country = "Other" THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END AS sorting
            FROM countries_others AS c
            GROUP BY 1
            ORDER BY sorting ASC, 1 ASC);
```
* Using `EXCEPT` and `AND` to compare two tables of value:

```SQL
SELECT 


            COUNT(ita.invoice_id) AS Invoices,
            1.0*COUNT(ita.invoice_id)/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoice) AS "%",

            CASE
                    WHEN (
                            SELECT il.track_id FROM invoice_line AS il
                            WHERE il.invoice_id = ita.invoice_id
                            
                            EXCEPT
                
                            SELECT t.track_id FROM track AS t
                            WHERE album_id = (SELECT album_id FROM track WHERE track_id = ita.first_track_id)
                          ) IS NULL
                          
                    AND
                         (
                            SELECT t.track_id FROM track AS t
                            WHERE album_id = (SELECT album_id FROM track WHERE track_id = ita.first_track_id)    
                    
                            EXCEPT
                
                            SELECT il.track_id FROM invoice_line AS il
                            WHERE il.invoice_id = ita.invoice_id
                          ) IS NULL
                          
                      THEN "Yes"
                      ELSE "No"
            END AS "Complete Purchase"
            FROM id_track_album AS ita
            GROUP BY 3
            ORDER BY 1;
```
