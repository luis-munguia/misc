# 4.- Introduction to Indexing

* Determine table schema with `PRAGMA table_info(tableName)`:

```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("factbook.db")
# The cursor object is created automatically.
schema = conn.execute("""PRAGMA table_info(facts);""").fetchall()
for row in schema:
    print(row)
```
* Query plans with `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`:

```SQL
/*This will return a high level query plan as a tuple;
the query results won't be returned */
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM facts;
```
```python
query_plan = conn.execute("EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM facts;").fetchall()
query_plan_one = conn.execute("EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM facts WHERE area > 40000;").fetchall()
query_plan_two = conn.execute("EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT area FROM facts WHERE area > 40000;").fetchall()
query_plan_three = conn.execute("EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM facts WHERE name = 'Czech Republic';").fetchall()
```

* Faster query using Binary Search, 0(log N) where N is the number of total rows in the table:

```python
query_plan_four = conn.execute("EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM facts WHERE id = 20;").fetchall()
```

* Full table scan:
```python
[(0, 0, 0, 'SCAN TABLE facts')]
```
* Binary search:
```python
[(0, 0, 0, 'SEARCH TABLE facts USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)')]
```

* Using `CREATE INDEX` statement to use binary search in a table:
```SQL
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);
# Using IF NOT EXISTS is better.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS area_idx ON facts(area);
```

```python
query_plan_six = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM facts WHERE population > 10000;").fetchall()
print(query_plan_six)
conn.execute("CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS pop_idx ON facts(population);")
query_plan_seven = conn.execute("EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM facts WHERE population > 10000;").fetchall()
print(query_plan_seven)
```
